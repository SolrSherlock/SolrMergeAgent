## Background ##
SolrMergeAgent is a complex system. Its task is easily describe as:

- Given a new Solr document (topic in the topic map), try to answer this question: *Have I seen this before?*

Answering that question becomes the task of a variety of tiny *single-purpose* agents. Each gets a *vote* on whether to merge or not.

## ToDo ##

It's huge...
